            <h3>Strawberries Hugged in Chocolate</3>
            <p>A simple and elegant treat perfect for any special occasion. These are super easy to make! </p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>2 cups of fresh, washed and dried strawberries</li>
              <li>1 cup of chocolate or candy chocolate flavored candy wafers with a 1/2 cup extra on the side</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Prepare a cookie sheet or any flat surface object that is freezer safe to use with parchment paper. You will need to work fast so chocolate doesn't cool too quickly.</li>
              <li>Melt your chocolate over a double-boiler or in the microwave using 30second intervals at 50% power level or use a chocolate candy melter machine. You want the chocolate to just be mostly melted. If it's too runny, add a little extra chocolate until it is smooth.</li>
              <li>Stir until smooth and cool down so thickness is not runny but looks like a thick cake batter consistency.</li>
              <li>Pour your melted chocolate in small deep bowl enough to fit the bottom half of the strawberry.</li>
              <li>Hand dip each strawberry into the chocolate until it is 1/2 way covered and pull directly out and let it rest on the parchment lined cookie sheet</li>
              <li>After you have placed as many chocolate dipped strawberries on your cookie sheet as you can in a single layer, place sheet in freezer for 10 minutes or until firm or use fridge to firm up chocolate.</li>
              <li>Pack up your chocolate in air tight containers and place in fridge until ready to use.</li>
              <li>If you are planning to serve them in a warmer climate, keep in fridge and then a few minutes just until serving move finished strawberries to room temperature.</li>
              <li>As long as your strawberries are not overripe, eat within 2 days after making them, otherwise very ripe strawberries may mean you need to eat them the same day.Remember to follow food safey rules with any perishable items.</li>

            <h3>Sponge Cake Leftover Trifle</3>
            <p>You made homemade spongecake, but now you have leftovers. An easy way to use it is to make a trifle in individual cups.</p>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>1/2 inch to 1 inch cut up spongecake or cake of your choice</li>
              <li>1 cup of very cold heavy whipping cream </li>
              <li>2 tablespoons of sugar </li>
              <li>pre-made pudding cups. flavor of your choices</li>
              <li>pre-frozen cut up mixed fruit or use ready made fruit cups drained of juice</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Depending on how much spongecake, you have leftover, you may have enough to fill a larger dish and serve from one large container or only enough to fill about 2 or 3 small fruit goblets. Your goal is to make fairly even layers of each of the ingredients. Feel free to change up proportions</li>
              <li> Make whipped topping. Whip up your whipping cream with sugar. You can use a handmixer or do this manually with a balloon whisk. You want just barely firm peaks so the top of the cream when you lift up the whisk just barely flops over. If you overmix, you will get butter. So be careful! </li>
              <li>In each of the serving dishes, layer a bottom layer of the spongecake pieces, a layer of pudding,a layer of fruit pieces, another layer of spongecake pieces, and top it off the whipped cream. </li>
              
              <li>This is a dessert that will not stay firm in very warm temperature so keep chilled until ready to serve. It is recommended to make and serve the same day for best results.</li>
