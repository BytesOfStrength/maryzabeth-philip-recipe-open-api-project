      <h2>The Importance of Using Fresh Ingredients that are in Season</h2>
      <p>
        Using fresh in-season ingredients is amazing when it is available. I love shopping for local ingredients from a neighborhood store. Fruit, like strawberries, harvested at the peak of its season give amazing depth flavor to any minimally processed recipe.
      </p>
      <h2>Weather Matters: The impact of weather on your recipes.</h2>
      <p>
        As someone who bakes and works with chocolate and fresh ingredients,
        understanding how weather can effect your recipes is a must. The
        environment's temperature and humidity can make a beautiful whipped
        cream frosted cake look like cake soup. That's why I take into account
        the weather and check out the the current weather when I start a new
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check out our <a href="weather.html">Weather Page</a> to see the current
        conditions in Maryland and learn how they may affect your recipe process
        or even your choice of recipe.
